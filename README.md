# COMP30850-Network-Analysis---2022-23
This repository contains the code and data for the COMP30850 Network Analysis course for the academic year 2022/23. The course consists of two assignments focused on constructing and analyzing network representations for movie-related datasets from IMDb and creating various network representations from pre-collected Twitter data for specific Twitter Lists.

# Assignment 1: Movie-Related Network Analysis
# Overview
The objective of this assignment is to construct and analyze network representations of two movie-related datasets from IMDb. These networks model the co-starring relations between actors, representing the collaboration network of actors who appear together in the same movies.

# Files and Directories
Assignment1/: Directory containing the code and data for Assignment 1.
Assignment1/actors_movies_data.csv: CSV file containing the movie-related dataset.
Assignment1/construct_movie_network.py: Python script for constructing the movie-related network.
Assignment1/analyze_movie_network.py: Python script for analyzing the movie-related network.
Assignment1/assignment1_report.pdf: Assignment report summarizing the analysis and findings.
Assignment 2: Twitter Network Analysis
Overview
The goal of this assignment is to create and characterize a range of different network representations using pre-collected Twitter data for a specific Twitter List of user accounts related to a specific topic (e.g., business, technology, etc).

# Files and Directories
Assignment2/: Directory containing the code and data for Assignment 2.
Assignment2/twitter_data.csv: CSV file containing the pre-collected Twitter data for the Twitter List.
